# Introduction
In this section we present the background of the dataset and the variables included. 
This project is dedicated to analyzing the factors affecting coffee quality. Utilizing data from the Coffee Quality Database (CQD), we aim to investigate how different features of coffee batches contribute to the overall quality classification as either good (score >= 82.5) or poor (score < 82.5).

# Data overview
The analysis focuses on the following attributes for each coffee batch:
country_of_origin: The country where the coffee originates.

aroma: Aroma grade of the coffee batch.

flavor: Flavor grade of the coffee batch.

acidity: Acidity grade of the coffee batch.

category_two_defects: Count of category 2 defects in the coffee batch.

altitude_mean_meters: Mean altitude of the grower's farm.

harvested: Harvest year of the coffee batch.

Qualityclass: Quality classification based on the score.

The datasets provided by the Coffee Quality Institute, a non-profit organization. The datasets include various attributes related to coffee production and quality assessment.

# Formal Analysis
In this section we have analysed and predicted the model by comparing the different models and removing some insignificant variables to arrive at a final model. We also suplly the correlated odds plots and probability plots.
